The Flower
***=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=***=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=***

The flower is the embodiment of many ideas
It shade of light purple is of that it shown
But the hidden meaning is that the people gives when interacted with
Ideas that is unique to the field of many different ideas
Ideas that is one of a kind
Ideas that are important in many ways

When winter is around the flowers withers away and dies
Winter is the end of the cycle and the start of the new
The flower in overall is the meaning of lost
Lost in the idea that its gone
People, ideas and more
Lost in a void
But now replace with something else
Something mix with the old and the new

Its color is the twilight sky when the sun rises on a new day.

The idea of the new fixing the old
The old is with us but the new will fix the old and stay with us
Even with the old forgotten the new will learn from the past and make amend
The idea is that nothing end but lives in a loop

A sound in the wind helps a soul to be guided
Through ideas, places, battles, and people
To find the missing part to make a whole
The old with the new is a relation that is beautiful
Undoubted that relation is what makes the world and universe beautiful

The flower, it withers away

But it blooms

Again

And Again

The day rise to greet the world
Both are in the light that the future will be hopeful
Hopeful that it will be never night
But night is slow and pain
The night can be over taken by the light

Light is warm to all
Even if they think that they don't need it
But all do

You need it

I need it

All of us need it

The meaning change but the idea does not
The darkness is the negatives to you while light is it opposite
But you will find your own way to use it and to find it in the mist of all
Find it, and never leave it out of your grasp
The season change as well
But not the light
The light is from ones source that you seek

Wake up from the slumber
Away from the darkness that its a embodiment of it
It is a idea that can cause chaos to one
Even if you embrace it
You will get lost

Wake up!

Fight but leave remorse for the darkness
Darkness follows our steps
Always around us in anyway.

The past is a never ending idea
It is all in ones mind
As it is needed to live
Even if you try your best to hid
You will find that you will need it once in a while
It something that when removed from our system, we die
Balance in nature and life is delicate
As well as our own ideas
It can never be the end to all
Just a new start

Grow

Grow to be be able to stay strong

Live

Live with remorse for all

Live with the past in mind

Live with and learn

The Purple Flower

Wake up
